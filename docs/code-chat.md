## Description

In the chat, you can ask questions about the codebase.
AI will answer your questions, and if necessary, it will offer code improvements.
This is very convenient when you want to quickly find something in the codebase, but don't want to waste time searching.
It is also convenient when you want to improve a specific function, you can ask "How can I improve the function {function name}?" and AI will suggest improvements.
Codebase is analyzed using openai.
